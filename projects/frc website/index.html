                Students continue to build robots from scratch to solve new challenges
                each season, competing against over 3000 teams from around the
                globe.</h3>

                using industrial parts, designed and fabricated by the students. Each season they are only given 2-3
                months until their first competition. They must prototype, design and build from zero in the given time.

            last season. We preformed extremely well at Bayou Reigonal Competition making <b>4th place</b> in qualifications
            out of more 50 teams and made finalist. We made great improvements to the teamâ€™s knowledge
            and skills, receiving the prestigious Innovation in Controls Award at the
            Magnolia Regional Competition.</h2>

                Founded in 2007, the Tigerbots are part of a larger organization called FIRST Robotics (For Inspiration
                and Recognition of Science and Technology).
                <br>
                <br>
                The mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be leaders in science and
                technology by engaging them in mentor-based programs that build science,
                engineering, and technology skills, while also building self-esteem, life skills,
                and community awareness.
