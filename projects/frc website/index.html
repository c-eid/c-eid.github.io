                using industrial parts, designed and fabricated by the students. Each season they are only given 2-3
                months until their first competition. They must prototype, design and build from zero in the given time.

                Founded in 2007, the Tigerbots are part of a larger organization called FIRST Robotics (For Inspiration

                <br>
                <br>
                The mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be leaders in science and
                technology by engaging them in mentor-based programs that build science,
                engineering, and technology skills, while also building self-esteem, life skills,
                and community awareness.
